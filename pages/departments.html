<title>Departnents</title>

Departments have been designed to better organize the team, so that each member and
volunteer can focus on the field(s) in which they have strengths. Also, in addition to the
individual work of each department, there is a permanent collaboration between all of them to
maximize results in all areas.

Mechanical department
<p>
The mechanical department deals with everything related to the construction, movement and
forces that produce the robot's movement. They use the application of principles and techniques
to solve engineering problems, from the design to the material manufacture of the robot,
combining creativity, knowledge and analytical tools to complete the difficult task of turning an
idea into reality.

Programming department
<p>
The programming department handles the process of writing code in Android Studio, using
Road Runner as well. Programmers create instructions for the computer to execute by writing
and testing the code that allows the robot to function successfully both to the commands given
by the drivers and to the automation part.

3D design department
<p>
The 3D design department deals with the process of using Onshape, Fusion and Blender to
create objects in a three-dimensional space, so as to be able to make the parts necessary to
make the robot, being in permanent contact with the mechanical department. They also deal
with everything involved in using 3D printers and overseeing the printing process.
