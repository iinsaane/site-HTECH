    <title>About us</title>

    <p> Our team was founded by Nicolae David, former member and leader. In the first season there
        were 30 members and volunteers from the same class. By the end of the season, only 11
        members remained, but they remain involved to this day as alumni and peer mentors. In
        addition to them, we also benefited from the help of former members from other teams, such as
        Autovortex, who, seeing our ambition, wanted to help us as much as they could.

    </p>
    <p>
        Since 2018, when our team was founded, throughout the 4 seasons in which we have
        participated, 21+ members and approximately 15 volunteers have collaborated, supported by 4+
        companies. This year we are 15 members and 12 volunteers.

    </p>
    <p></p>
    At the same time, the H-Tech team was rebuilt. From new members and volunteers guided by
    two peer mentors in a totally different way, to more rigorous organization and constant
    deadlines, we constantly try to focus on improving and growing the team. The new
    organizational structure positively influenced our determination, and the activity was held at the
    new headquarters, a room within the FIIR UPB faculty.

    </p>
    <p>

        We constantly try to combine the implementation of the team's purpose with the personal
        development and creativity of the members to improve our performance within the FTC. We
        rigorously used the resources made available by both First Tech Challenge and Natie pir
        Educatie, and we made sure that we did not violate any of the rules imposed in order not to
        encounter problems during the competitions.
    </p>

    Our team structure is simple, with each member or volunteer being part of one or more
    departments:

    <ul>
        <li> Mechanical department </li>
        <li> Programming department </li>
        <li> 3D design department </li>
        <li> PR + Marketing department </li>
        <li> Design and editing department </li>
    </ul>
